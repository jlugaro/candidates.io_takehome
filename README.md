  
## Getting Started

First, setup your `.env or local.env` file.

copy the content of `sample_env` into `.env or local.env`, make sure to not commit any of these files when submitting your changes.


 Install the dependencies
```bash

npm install

# or

yarn

```

Then, run the development server:
  

```bash

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/](http://localhost:3000/api/). The endpoints can be found in `pages/api/`.

  

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
